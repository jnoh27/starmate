This is the farthest galaxy in which Hubble has identified Cepheid variable stars. These are important milepost markers for measuring the expansion rate of the universe. The distance calculated from Cepheids has been cross-correlated with a type Ia supernova in the galaxy. Type Ia supernovae are so bright they are used to measure cosmic distances far beyond the range of the Cepheids, extending measurements of the universe's expansion rate deeper into space.",

If they are lucky, perhaps they might capture an interstellar comet, or perhaps they will train Webb on a comet similar to Hale\u2013Bopp, shown above in a ground-based photo shortly after passing perihelion in April 1997. Comet Hale\u2013Bopp, thought to be from the Oort Cloud, was one of the brightest comets seen for many decades. Visible to the naked eye for a record 18 months, it could be seen even from major cities with light-polluted skies.",
