Webb identified carbon dioxide on the icy surface of Europa that likely originated in the moon\u2019s subsurface ocean. This discovery has important implications for the potential habitability of Europa\u2019s ocean. The moon appears mostly blue because it is brighter at shorter infrared wavelengths. The white features correspond with the chaos terrain Powys Regio (left) and Tara Regio (center and right), which show enhanced carbon dioxide ice on the surface.",
